The primary principle is Authorization Independence, achieved by storing tasks under user-specific paths, thus eliminating the need for `get()` calls in security rules. This structure directly supports the QAP (Rules are not Filters) principle by ensuring that listing tasks is always scoped to a specific user, enabling secure and efficient queries.\n\nSpecifically, all tasks for a user are stored under `/users/{userId}/tasks/{taskId}`.  This design means ownership is implicitly defined by the path itself, enforcing that only the authenticated user (`request.auth.uid`) can access tasks under their respective user ID."
